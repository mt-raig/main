You will be given two topic sets. Your task is to match topics bidirectionally based on their semantic similarity, ensuring that both sets are treated with equal importance.

Each topic can match multiple topics in the other set. Do not prioritize topic set A or B either. Treat them as equally important in determining semantic similarity.

Focus on relative semantic similarity within the context, not absolute values or external pairs. Avoid matches solely based on identical numerical values shared with unrelated pairs.

Provide no additional text or explanation.

Your **Output** must follow this exact format:
Matched topic subset of A: [list of matched topic numbers from the topic set A]
Matched topic subset of B: [list of matched topic numbers from the topic set B]
